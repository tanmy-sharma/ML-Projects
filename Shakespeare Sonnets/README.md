# Shakespeare Sonnets

Generating Shakespearean sonnets using next character prediction is a fascinating application of natural language processing and deep learning techniques. In this approach, a machine learning model is trained on a large corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets to predict the next character in a sequence of text. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. Data Collection: To begin, a dataset containing Shakespeare's sonnets is collected. This dataset should include all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets. We used the dataset present in this (link)[https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt].
2. Data Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed to a numeric data by divinding the data into a sequence of characters and then assigning all the characters a unique index value, which we can later use to convert the numeric value back to it's actual text. 
3. Model Architecture: Next, a deep learning model is constructed for next character prediction. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are commonly used due to their ability to capture sequential dependencies in the text, followed by a Dense Layer with Softmax activation to get the probability of the occurance of each character.
4. Training: The model is trained on the prepared dataset. During training, the model learns the statistical patterns and language structure present in Shakespearean sonnets by predicting the next character in a sequence.
5.Text Generation: Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate new Shakespearean sonnets. Starting with an initial seed text or character, the model generates subsequent characters by sampling from the predicted probability distribution over characters. This process is repeated until the desired length of the sonnet is achieved.
