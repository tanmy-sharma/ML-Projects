# TextSummarization

## Overview:

Text summarization is the process of generating short, fluent, and most importantly accurate summary of a respectively longer text document. The main idea behind automatic text summarization is to be able to find a short subset of the most essential information from the entire set and present it in a human-readable format. As online textual data grows, automatic text summarization methods have the potential to be very helpful because more useful information can be read in a short time.
Why automatic text summarization?
  1. Summaries reduce reading time.
  2. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.
  3. Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.
  4. Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarization.
  5. Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information.
  6. Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of text documents they are able to process.

Types of Text Summarization:
  1. Extractive, where important sentences are selected from the input text to form a summary. Most summarization approaches today are extractive in nature. [Code](https://github.com/tanmy-sharma/TextSummarization/blob/main/Extractive%20Summarization.ipynb)
  2. Abstractive, where the model forms its own phrases and sentences to offer a more coherent summary, like what a human would generate. This approach is definitely more appealing, but much more difficult than extractive summarization.
